# ProjectEuler
Some of my solutions to Project Euler

I started Project Euler back in 2011/2012 as a way to learn Fortran 90. When I improved enough, I stopped trying to answer the questions and forgot all about it. At the time, I had roughly the first 40 problems solved (out of 300 or so) and a few later ones; sadly in the multiple computers I've owned since solving them, I've lost the programs. I've little interest in re-solving those problems, so they're gone forever.

Note also that I'll not be posting *every* solution I have, just *some* of them.
