# ProjectEuler
**Some of my solutions to Project Euler**

I started Project Euler back in 2011/2012 as a way to learn Fortran 90. When I improved enough, I stopped trying to answer the questions and forgot all about it. At the time, I had roughly the first 40 problems solved (out of 300 or so) and a few later ones; sadly in the multiple computers and operating systems (all Linux) I've owned since solving them, I've lost the programs. I've little interest in re-solving those problems, so they're gone forever (which I guess sorta sucks because some of them were rather neat/crafty uses of Fortran, but whatever).

Note also that I'll not be posting *every* solution I have, just *some* of them. Some of the more difficult ones (Difficulty Rating > 70%) might be partially redacted because those problems took some cunning and I don't want you to have such an easy answer. Some of the answers are also brute-force solutions that could work if you had a few days (or more) to run the computation (well beyond the "minute" allowed).
